# BlErrorDomain error 3

To be able to run Big Sur installer on unsupported mac, you'll need:

- Working Catalina installation
- Patcher

There is two ways to patch it:

1. Use my tool, called [Big Sur, Please](https://github.com/4ndv/big-sur-plz)
2. Do it manually

You can read more on how to do this in my Big Sur installation guide here: [https://medium.com/@andv/how-to-install-big-sur-to-mac-mini-late-2012-9d674b563174](https://medium.com/@andv/how-to-install-big-sur-to-mac-mini-late-2012-9d674b563174)
