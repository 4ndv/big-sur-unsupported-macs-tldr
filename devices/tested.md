# Devices, tested to be able to install Big Sur

My guide for how to install on Mac Mini Late 2012 and other Catalina-capable devices, including WiFi: https://medium.com/@andv/how-to-install-big-sur-to-mac-mini-late-2012-9d674b563174

If your machine is not Catalina-capable, it may require additional steps, look in the "Common Issues" section.

Wifi will not work out of the box for most devices, but can be set up. Look up [Common Issues -> Wifi Not Working](common_issues/wifi.md).

If you have non-Metal GPU, graphics acceleration will not work for now.

This list is not complete, you can submit your successful attempt to the GitHub issues or add it yourself.

## Mac Mini
