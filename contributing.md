# Contributing

In order to directly contribute to this website, you will need to Fork this repository on GitHub, install [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) locally, make all the needed changes, and create a Pull Request to the main repo.

Also, you can open an GitHub issue, and i'll do the required changes myself, but if you can - fork and create PR. Thank you!
